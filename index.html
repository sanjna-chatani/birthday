    <p>
        Babe, I know that I can wish you simply on chat, or I can just wish you by creating a poster or something like that, but I chose this way to wish you. Now listen to me very carefully, what I am going to say might hurt you babe, but I have to say it. We have had many fights in the last 1 year and 7 months, but the way we had our last one, 2 days back, I think that was very painful for both of us. I forced you to choose me and this relationship above you. And the way you handled everything was unbelievable for me. Yesterday night, whatever happened on the VC, the way you ignored all those things, I want to thank you for that and sorry for always being like this. Btw, I don't want to thank you just for this; I want to thank you for doing everything, for taking care of me, my choices, my career, family, and what not. But I think you were right a few days back when you said that it's time to focus on our career instead of our relationship. I don't know what we are going to face, but let me promise you one thing: <span style="color: red;">I would never, ever do crazy stuff like blocking you just to get attention, and I want to repeat that promise that "I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER EVER GONNA BREAK UP WITH YOU BABE."</span> I am sorry for saying this at this moment, like it's just the start of your birthday, and reminding you about all those bad moments, but I did it because I regret what I did, even after knowing everything.
        Babe, please forgive me, please.
        AND YEAH, YOU ADDED ONE MORE YEAR TO YOUR JOURNEY. CONGRATULATIONS FOR SURVIVING ONCE AGAIN. MANY MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY BACHA.
        <span style="color: rgba(234, 93, 37, 0.961);">I wish I could be with you on days like this, babe. I am eagerly waiting for the day we can celebrate our moments together.</span>
        <span style="color: rgb(4, 252, 128);">I LOVE YOU SO MUCH &#129303; ONCE AGAIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABE &#129395;&#129395;</span>
    </p>
